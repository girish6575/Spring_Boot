<!-- 
timeToIdleSeconds enables cached object to be kept in as long as it is requested in periods shorter than timeToIdleSeconds. 
timeToLiveSeconds will make the cached object be invalidated after that many seconds irregardless of how many times 
or when it was requested.
Let's say that timeToIdleSeconds = 3. Object will be invalidated if it hasn't been requested for 4 seconds.
If timeToLiveSeconds = 90 then the object will be removed from cache after 90 seconds even if it has been 
requested few milliseconds in the 90th second of its short life.
